1. Section 2 title: 
Distributed revision control system.

2. Section 2 contents:
In distributed revision control systems (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar lub Darcs) clients do not get access only to the news version of files but they copy the whole repository. When one of the servers used by these systems to inter-cooperate fails, the repository of any client can simply be copied to the server in order to restore it to work.
